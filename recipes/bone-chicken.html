        <p>Sure, boneless, skinless chicken thighs are convenient… but there's so much more flavor to be had with bone-in chicken thighs.</p>
        <p>You see, the bones contain one of the most flavorful parts of the bird: the bone marrow. When cooked, this marrow seeps into the meat, resulting in a more robust chicken flavor.</p>
        <p>Plus, bone-in chicken thighs tend to be cheaper than their boneless counterparts. In sum, you really can't go wrong with bone-in chicken thighs, whether you choose to roast them, pan-fry them, or even air fry them. Here are 28 bone-in chicken thigh recipes to get you started</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, with skin</li> 
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
            <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot of an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) on Sauté mode; add chicken. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving drippings in the pot.</li>
            <li>Place mushrooms, celery, and onion in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken back in the pot; add tomatoes and tomato paste. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Top with water and bouillon.</li>
            <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Cook for 11</li>
            <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully, turning it away from you. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season to taste with red pepper flakes and black pepper.</li>
